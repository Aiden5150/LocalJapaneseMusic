	<h2>Aimyon</h2>
	<p>Aimyon(あいみょん) was born on March 6, 1995, in the city of Nishinomiya in Hyōgo Prefecture. She was influenced to become a singer-songwriter in part because of her grandmother, who herself aspired to be a singer, and her father, who worked as an audio engineer. During her middle school years, she began writing songs and doing covers with the acoustic guitar her English teacher left her. When she was in high school, her friend sent her application to an audition without her knowledge, and she qualified for the final rounds. After graduating from high school, a YouTube video of one of her performances caught the attention of her first music label, Lastrum Music Entertainment. Aimyon wrote the lyrics for the song "Time Goes By" from the third single of the boy group Johnny's West, released on February 4, 2015. On March 4, 2015, she made her indie debut with the single "Anata Kaibou Junaika (Shine)", a release available only at Tower Records which entered the Oricon Indies top ten chart. Later, in May 2015, she released her first mini-album, Tamago, and her second mini-album, Nikumarekko Yo ni Habakaru, in December of the same year. Aimyon was signed to Warner sub-label Unborde, and released her major label debut single "Ikite Itanda yona" on November 30, 2016. On December 31, 2018, she made her first appearance on the 69th edition of NHK's Kouhaku Uta Gassen, Japan's prestigious New Year's Eve music program, and performed her song "Marigold". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimyon" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
