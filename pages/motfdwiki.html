	<h2>Mass of the Fermenting Dregs</h2>
	<p>Mass of the Fermenting Dregs was formed in 2002 in Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture, with the original all-female lineup of Natsuko Miyamoto, Chiemi Ishimoto and Reiko Gotoh. Following Reiko's departure from the band in October 2007, the band toured with the official lineup of Natsuko and Chiemi, with various musicians serving as a "support drummer". Their breakthrough came at the 2007 "Road to Tarbox Audition" competition held by EMI Japan, which put the band in contact with noted American record producer Dave Fridmann (The Flaming Lips, OK Go) of Tarbox Road Studios. With Fridmann producing, they recorded two tracks, I F A Surfer and Bears (ベアーズ), which appeared on their 2008 self-titled E.P. In 2010, support drummer Yoshino Tsutomu became an official member of the band, prior to the release of their major label debut album. In October 2010, it was announced that the band's guitarist of six years, Chiemi Ishimoto, would be leaving the group after completing the band's national tour on December 11, 2010. Her leaving was due to a medical panic disorder. Ishimoto's last performance was held at the Shibuya Club Quattro. Guitarist and lead vocalist Eriko Hashimoto of the band Chatmonchy attended the performance, sharing the enthralling experience of the final performance of "End Roll" on her official blog on her band's official website. In December 2011, Yoshino Tsutomu announced that he would be leaving the group for undisclosed reasons. This left Miyamoto as the sole founding and active member of the band. Though Natsuko Miyamoto, with the help of supporting members, continued to perform as Mass of the Fermenting Dregs through the spring of 2012, on September the 1st of the same year, she officially announced that Mass of the Fermenting Dregs would cease to exist as of that day. As a parting present, Miyamoto shared the last of the works recorded while Tsutomu was still a member. A song titled "たんたんたん" (tantantan) was made available for download through a direct link placed within the page containing the departing letter to the fans on the official M.o.F.D. website. In December the M.o.F.D website started to update, deleting the departing letter on the website. Natusko Miyamoto sent hints on Twitter about M.o.F.D, and the band was later confirmed to play on the New Year's Q2 Concert, thus confirming the reunion of the band. In May, 2016, the band played in three Canadian cities on the "Next Music From Tokyo" concert tour. Natsuko explained the origin of the unusual band name in an interview with music retailer HMV: "It doesn't have any particular meaning, we just lined up a few words that we liked." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/MASS+OF+THE+FERMENTING+DREGS/+wiki" target="_blank">Last FM source</a> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_of_the_Fermenting_Dregs" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
