As an enthusiast of Japanese culture in general we want to share the music that we know and discovered over time. We also want to broaden the appreciation of everyone on music and to listen not only to our own local musicians but to discover different taste of music, Japanese music has a something that is different or unique from other western bands although the genres are technically from the west like Alternative Rock, Shoegaze, Punk Rock, etc., and some of the genres even originate in UK (United Kingdom). We appreciate Japanese music in different factors, some of us discover music from the anime and if someone like the soundtrack they will find a way to find what band composed that song, and some of us also discover music intentionally by following that band, buying their digital records online or via streaming songs on different online platforms. Japanese music just sound differently just like other asian music, because some of the bands just produce a sound that is so western like sound, we appreciate Japanese Music because they sound different there is something good to them that is different to western sound, for example vocaloid, when it says vocaloid it is very popular in Japan since it started in Japan as far as I know. Japanese artists has a broad technique in producing this kind of music. Yes! Japan is different because they are very innovative and just like them we may also make different innovative ideas in producing music.
