	<h2>SCANDAL</h2>
	<p>Scandal (Japanese: スキャンダル, Hepburn: Sukyandaru, stylized as SCANDAL) is an all-female Japanese rock band from Osaka. Formed in August 2006 by four high school girls, they played live street performances until they were noticed and signed to the indie label Kitty Records. Although all four members have provided lead vocals, their primary roles are Haruna on vocals and rhythm guitar, Mami on lead guitar, Tomomi on bass guitar, and Rina on drums. In 2008, they released three singles and a mini-album while simultaneously touring the United States, France, and Hong Kong. That October, Scandal released their major debut single, "Doll", on Epic Records Japan. The band has performed the theme songs for several anime series, including "Shōjo S" and "Harukaze" for Bleach and "Shunkan Sentimental" for Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. With numerous overseas performances and anime theme songs, Scandal has built a considerable international fanbase. They sold 1,4 million copies in Japan. Scandal was formed in August 2006 by four high school girls. The girls, Haruna, Mami, Tomomi, and Rina, met in an Osaka vocal and dance school called Caless. Shortly thereafter, they started performing live performances every weekend at Shiroten in Osaka Castle Park. Soon, they started getting offers from clubs in Osaka and Kyoto. The band's name originates from a sign near Studio Brotherz, a studio where they practiced in their early days. The studio is on the sixth floor of a building shared with other businesses, namely adult shops. The girls decided to choose the biggest sign among the shops, "Scandal" (スキャンダル, Sukyandaru), as the name for their band. Yellow, Scandal's seventh album, was released on March 2, 2016. The band released the single "Take Me Out" on July 27, 2016, in celebration of their tenth anniversary. Scandal's eleventh anniversary concert on August 21, 2017, was recorded for the October 21 episode of the television show Storytellers. Their eighth studio album Honey was released in Japan on February 14, 2018, and in Europe on March 2. Honey peaked at number 3 on the Oricon weekly charts, extending their streak of being the only girl band to consecutively have their albums reach the top 5 of the charts to 8.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandal_(Japanese_band) " target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
